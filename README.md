# gust
- My deployment for an airflow server on a VM via GCP 
- This is done as an alternative to using the managed Composer on GCP
- Virtual machine pulls this `docker-compose.yaml` file and runs it in the background


## Ideas for future
- add terraform code to create the VM
- try deploy it using cloud run instead of with a VM, compare cost
